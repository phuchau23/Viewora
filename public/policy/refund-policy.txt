Please read this Refund Policy carefully before making a purchase. By purchasing tickets from Viewora, you agree to the terms of this Refund Policy.

## 1. General Refund Conditions

All ticket sales are generally final. Refunds are only issued under specific circumstances as detailed below.

## 2. Eligibility for Refunds

You may be eligible for a refund under the following conditions:

* **Cancelled Screenings:** If a movie screening is cancelled by Viewora for any reason (e.g., technical issues, unforeseen circumstances), you will be entitled to a full refund for the ticket price. We will endeavor to notify you of cancellations as soon as possible.
* **Rescheduled Screenings:** If a movie screening is rescheduled, you will have the option to:
    * Use your original ticket for the rescheduled screening.
    * Receive a full refund for the ticket price.
* **Technical Issues Preventing Ticket Use:** If you experience a demonstrable technical issue with our Site that prevents you from completing your purchase or accessing your e-ticket, and we are unable to resolve it promptly, you may be eligible for a refund. Please contact us immediately if you encounter such an issue.
* **Booking Error (Limited Circumstances):** In rare cases of a clear and verifiable booking error on our part (e.g., incorrect date or time booked despite correct selection by the customer, and immediate notification), we may consider a refund or exchange on a case-by-case basis. This does not apply to customer errors in selecting dates, times, or movies.

## 3. Non-Refundable Situations

Refunds will generally **not** be issued in the following situations:

* **Change of Mind:** We do not offer refunds if you simply change your mind, are unable to attend the screening, or have conflicting commitments after purchasing a ticket.
* **Late Arrival or No-Show:** If you arrive late for a screening or do not show up, your ticket will not be eligible for a refund.
* **Dissatisfaction with Movie Content:** We do not offer refunds based on dissatisfaction with the movie's content, plot, or acting.
* **Ticket Holder Errors:** Errors made by the ticket purchaser, such as selecting the wrong movie, showtime, date, or number of tickets, are generally not eligible for refunds. Please double-check your selection before completing your purchase.
* **External Factors:** Events outside of Viewora's control that do not directly impact the screening (e.g., traffic delays, personal emergencies) are not grounds for a refund.

## 4. How to Request a Refund

To request a refund for an eligible situation, please follow these steps:

1.  **Contact Us Promptly:** For cancellations or rescheduled screenings, we will typically initiate refunds automatically or provide clear instructions. For other eligible situations, you must contact us as soon as possible.
2.  **Provide Proof of Purchase:** You will need to provide your ticket confirmation number, email address used for purchase, and any other relevant booking details.
3.  **Explain the Reason:** Clearly explain the reason for your refund request, providing any supporting information (e.g., screenshots of technical issues).

## 5. Refund Processing

* **Refund Method:** Approved refunds will typically be issued to the original payment method used for the purchase.
* **Processing Time:** Please allow 7 business days for the refund to be processed and appear on your statement, depending on your bank or payment provider.
* **Non-Transferable:** Refunds are non-transferable and will only be issued to the original purchaser.

## 6. Exchanges

In some cases, Viewora may offer ticket exchanges for a different showtime or movie, at our sole discretion, particularly for specific unforeseen circumstances or if you contact us well in advance of the original showtime. Exchanges are subject to ticket availability and may incur an administrative fee.

## 7. Management Discretion

Viewora reserves the right to make final decisions on all refund and exchange requests on a case-by-case basis. Our management's decision is final.
